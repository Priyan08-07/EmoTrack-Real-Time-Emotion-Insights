OVERVIEW

EmoTrack is a real-time emotion recognition system leveraging Computer Vision & Deep Learning. It classifies emotions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and integrates facial landmark detection for enhanced accuracy.

OBJECTIVE

EmoTrack - Real-Time Emotion Insights
The objective of EmoTrack is to develop a real-time emotion recognition system using Computer Vision and Deep Learning. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and facial landmark detection, the system aims to classify emotions with high accuracy from live video streams.

ALGORITHM USED

EmoTrack utilizes **Deep Learning and Computer Vision** techniques for real-time emotion recognition. The core algorithms include:  

 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
   - Used for **feature extraction and classification** of facial emotions.  
   - Processes facial expressions from **live video streams**.  
   - Trained on labeled emotion datasets for accurate predictions.  

 OpenCV for Real-Time Processing**
   - Captures frames from **live video** using webcam/camera feeds.  
   - Preprocesses images before sending them to the CNN model.  
   - Efficiently detects and tracks faces in real-time.  

Softmax Classifier for Emotion Prediction**
   - Outputs probabilities for each emotion category.  
   - Classifies emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, neutral, surprised, etc.**  

 Why These Algorithms?
 CNNs provide robust feature extraction from facial images.  
 OpenCV enables real-time processing for practical applications.  

MODEL ARCHITECTURE

CNN-Based Emotion Recognition System
EmoTrack's deep learning pipeline is built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with additional enhancements for real-time emotion detection.

Data Preprocessing
Face Detection → Extracts faces using OpenCV/Dlib/Mediapipe.

Grayscale Conversion → Converts images to grayscale for better feature extraction.

Image Resizing → Standardizes input size (e.g., 48×48 or 64×64 pixels).

Normalization → Scales pixel values between 0-1 to improve convergence.
